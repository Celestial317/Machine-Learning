# What is ML?
-- A domain where we use mathematical models to help machine learn and generalise patterns.

# AI vs ML vs DL?
-- AI is a concept of achieving autonomous intelligence to ease out human effort with smart solutions.
-- AI is achieved by ML and DL
-- ML is use of maths but with manual feature engineering
-- DL use of activation function to introduce non-linearty for feature engineering.

# Types of ML?
-- Supervised Learning : Labeled input and output for training
-- Unsupervised Learning : Non- Labeled, intended to cluster based on similarity
-- Reinforcement Learning : Introducing reward-penality method for RL Agent to take actions based on current state for maximum reward.

# Batch vs Online Learning?
-- Batch Learning : Model trains on the whole dataset, no updatation based on new data is involved.
-- Online Learning : Model tranins on small chunks, increamentation of model training based on new data.

# Instance Based vs Model Based Learning?
-- Instance Based : Model doesnt trains on data but memorises it and uses algorithm after input is given. Eg: KNN
-- Model Based : Model trains on data and finds patterns. Eg: Decision Trees

# What are Tensors?
-- An algebraic container to store numbers.
-- 0D - Scaler 
-- 1D - Vector (1D array)
-- 2D - Matrix (2D array)
-- No. of Axes = Dimension = Rank of Tensor

# Data Gathering
-- CSV - pd.read_csv("File_name")
-- JSON - Javascript Object Notation | key-value Pair | pd.read_json("File_name or URL")
-- SQL - Structure Query Language | Use mysql.connector | pd.read_sql_query("QUERY", connection_obj)
-- API Fetching - Data piplelines | API calls give data | use request library
-- Web-Scraping - (When API is not avialable) | use BeautifulSoup | Parse HTML, extract tags as needed

# EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) 
## Univariate
-- Analysis on single column
## Bivariate and Multivariate
--
